Ramu Kaka *Slack Bot* `Version 0.1`

## Chat Bot for GSIUXD Slack Community

Hello everyone! It’s my pleasure to give you a small announcement; We’re building a chat bot to greet onboarding users especially for our GSIUXD UX Slack community. Since this community is India specific, we thought of giving this bot an interesting name, and why not! So let's call our bot `Ramu Kaka` for now. 


## Ramu Kaka - A Slack Chat Bot

`Ramu Kaka` is india's first _indi_ chat bot on slack to greet onboarding users. This slack bot `Ramu Kaka` can hear most of your messages, but will reply to conversations those are _specific_. I've written a brief `read me` file to include some of its basic chat parameters followed by some examples. Let's look at how this slack chat bot can listen and replies to your conversations. 

## Limitations

As of `2nd Dec 2016`, this chat bot will only work inside GSIUXD Slack Team via _direct message_, _direct mention_, or _mention_ based events for now, and of course. We don't want to clutter our other channel feeds with such testings. We’ll make it global over time so that others can install this bot app into multiple slack teams. This bot will be functioning via local server. 

## How to use?

1. Sign in to [GSIUXD Slack Community](https://getstartedinuxdesign.slack.com/) using desktop, mobile browser, or app.
2. If you’re new user, get an [invite to join](https://gsiuxd.herokuapp.com/). 
3. Once signed in, chat with our chat bot `Ramu Kaka` by using `@ramukaka` by opening a direction message via slack. When you click on the direction messages, you will see a screen like this. Just type out `ramukaka` and the bot will appear upfront.
