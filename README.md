## Slack Chatbot

`Ramu Kaka` is india's first chat bot on slack to greet onboarding users. This slack bot `Ramu Kaka` can hear most of your mesages, but will reply to conversations those are _specific_. I've written a brief readme file to include some of its basic chat parameters followed by some examples. Let's look at what are they.

### Introduction
###### Ramu Kaka, first indi slack bot

We've designed this chat bot to greet onboarding users especially for our GSIUXD UX Slack community. Since this community is India specific, we thought of giving this bot an interesting name, and why not! So let's call our bot `Ramu Kaka` and this is how he looks ðŸ‘³ right now.

I'll come back to this documentation with more details as we make changes over time.

This goes by the end of the file; it works as an "else" function for listener events.

```javascript
controller.hears(".*", ["direct_message", "direct_mention"], function (bot, message) {
    bot.reply(message, "Sorry <@" + message.user + ">, I don\'t understand. \n");
});
```
